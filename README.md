- [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/shiny/projects/3)
- [Demo: late.ink](https://late.ink)

## What's late.ink

late.ink is a web panel for SSL cerificate issuance / renewal / deployment.

The design features include:

- Issue the certficates via ACME protocol
- Auto-renewing certficates
- Auto-deploying certificates

We should encrypt traffics everywhere,whether for individuals or small teams, regardless of hardware

So the major design ideas are:

- Cost small memory so it can run anywhere.
- Works well on shaky networks
- Open-Source & Self-hosted, also supports SaaS
- Simple & Easy to use
- Future-focused
